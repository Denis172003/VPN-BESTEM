# VPN-BESTEM

In partnership with the Kernel Killers team, consisting of Ionu»õ, Fabian, Mihai, and myself, we successfully developed a dedicated VPN (Virtual Private Network) within the condensed timeframe of a 24-hour hackathon.
This innovative solution facilitated the expeditious alteration of our IP location to Paris.
